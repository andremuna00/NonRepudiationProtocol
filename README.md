## 🔎 Overview

### ❓ Problem Description
A **Non-Repudiation Protocol** ensures that neither the sender 📨 nor the receiver 📬 of a message can deny their participation in the communication process. This is crucial for secure communications 🔐, particularly in:
- 💻 Digital contracts  
- 🛒 E-commerce  
- 📝 Sensitive transactions  

Our aim is to:
- 🔧 Represent protocol components and their interactions.
- 📈 Analyze system performance and derive key measures such as:
  - Steady-state probabilities 📊  
  - Throughput 🚀  
  - Utilization 📉
